Easily add social sharing buttons to your posts and images without slowing down your site with unnecessary javascript and image files.

== Description ==

Add social sharing buttons to your posts without slowing your website down.

Default sharing buttons provided by Facebook and other sites require that your users download many additional javascript, css, and image files. Every additional download increases your sites page loading time. A slow website can lose visitors and lower your Google page rank.

This plugin's sharing buttons require no images or font icon files to download, and only an optional 4kb CSS file.

Add buttons to share your posts for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and Email. Automatically display buttons in the header or footer of your posts, or use shortcodes for including them within your content or template files.

Select between two styles: either minimal icon buttons, or share buttons with added share count. Show the number of times the post has been shared on each service. The share count option requires javascript.

If you have image heavy content, add share buttons directly on your posts' media, as seen on popular sites such as Buzzfeed.

For advanced theme developers, default plugin styles and scripts can be disabled. Include the plugin's CSS or Sass in your theme's styles to reduce additional HTTP Requests. Or completely customize the look and feel of the buttons with easily style-able HMTL and class names.
