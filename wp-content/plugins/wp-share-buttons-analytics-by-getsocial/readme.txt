**What is different about GetSocial to other plugins and tools?**

From the feedback we've been receiving from thousands of users, people join GetSocial for its design, easy installation, great support and in-depth analytics.

You also get several simple to read dashboards with social analytics about your website.

**How do I upgrade and pay for GetSocial?**

Upgrading your GetSocial account is quick and easy. On your account, you'll find multiple times our “Upgrade Plan” call to action buttons.

Clicking on one of these buttons will guide you to our pricing page. Here, you'll find the list of features included on each plan.

After you have decided which plan you want to subscribe to (we recommend the Annual plan as it provides with 2 months free as a discount), you just need to click on “Upgrade” and provide your billing details.

**What is the Copy Paste Share Tracking?**

If you imagine the last times you shared something, it's probable that you haven't done so by clicking on a share button. If you're sharing a video to a friend or sending a link via email, you're sharing something and normally that doesn't get measured.

What happens is that you'll have these people being identified as “direct” traffic to your website. They're not. The Copy & Paste Share Tracking feature allows you to track private (or dark social) sharing, which is sharing via alternative methods such as copy-paste, chats and link sharing in general. If you want to know more about this, just <a href="http://help.getsocial.io/using-getsocial/what-is-the-copy-paste-share-tracking-app">read our article</a>.
